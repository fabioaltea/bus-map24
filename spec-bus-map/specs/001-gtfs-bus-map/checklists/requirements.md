# Specification Quality Checklist: GTFS Bus Map Explorer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items passed on first validation iteration.
- GTFS data sourcing assumption (curated pre-loaded feeds, no user upload in v1) documented
  in Assumptions rather than left as a clarification, as this is a reasonable scope boundary
  for a v1 product.
- Real-time data explicitly out of scope per user description — recorded in FR-009 and Assumptions.
- Mobile layout out-of-scope for v1 but documented to prevent active regression.
